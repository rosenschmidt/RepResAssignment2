Coursera Reproducible Research Peer Assignment 2 - not the assignment,
but my own repository of work to date.

I've decided to use assigment 1's lessons and use github as the repository
for my work, so that I can keep track of versions of it, etc.

I've discovered an entirely new way of doing the assigment,
so I want to re-do it but keep track of what i've done so far.
